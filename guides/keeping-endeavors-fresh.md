Guide: Keeping Endeavors Fresh
==== 

At the beginning of 2017 we identified [over 25 endeavors that had become stale](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/781614b51f9abc9fa831dc2843c1775dbb55907d/ROADMAP.md#stale-endeavors). All of these stale endeavors were suffering from neglect. Some of them desperately needed to be revived, some needed just a bit of attention, and others needed to be set free.
We (the ipfs maintainers) put our heads together to identify _why_ endeavors go stale (Diagnosis) and what actions we can take to keep them fresh or set them free (Remedies). Here's what we came up with:

## Diagnosis

- We're creative and like to hack new things, not so good at follow-up
- Peopel asked for it so we started creating it.
- de-prioritized without clear message about de-prioritized status
	- and without communitcation about next steps
- No DRI or DRI overcommitted
- Blocked, moved on
- Process failure
	- Process not clear
	- No DRI, DRI not committed
	- No process for updating
	- Not incorporated into ongoing work
- Handed to external people
- Lost interest: Hard work, not incrementally rewarding
	- not incentivized
- Marketing failure
- Important unclear

## Remedies

- Allocate time and make clear plan of action
- Clarify importance
- Assign (or re-assgin) a DRI and allocate time for them to work
- "Kill it"
- Hand it off
	- put it in a box on the church steps
		clean up first
- Clearly mark it de-prioritized "mothballed"
	- Captains Log: "abandoned ship, "closed indefinitely", "scuttled"
	- Notify ipfs/notes
- Require Captain's Logs (to force visibility of DRI's commitments)
- Recruit a new captain to do it well
- Recruit Helpers / "lieutenants" + contributors/testers feedback-givers
- Fix the process
	- .. so that the endeavor gets updated regularly as part of other work (ie. updating specs)
	- .. so it's automated (ie. generating distros)
	- by documenting how to keep it up to date
